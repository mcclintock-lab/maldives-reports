                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Fish catch is used as a proxy for measuring the potential
                  economic loss to fisheries caused by the creation of protected
                  areas. This report can be used to minimize the potential
                  impact of a plan fisheries, as well as identify and reduce
                  conflict between conservation objectives and fishing
                  activities. The higher the percentage, the greater the
                  potential impact if access or activities are restricted.
