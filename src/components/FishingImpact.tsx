                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Fishing Effort is used as a proxy for measuring the
                  potential economic loss to fisheries caused by the creation of
                  protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the
                  potential impact of a plan on a fishery, as well as identify
                  and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and
                  fishing activities.

                  üìà Report: Percentages are calculated by summing the areas of
                  fishing effort within the MPAs in this plan, and dividing it
                  by the total area of fishing effort in the overall planning
                  area. If the plan includes multiple areas that overlap, the
                  overlap is only counted once.
