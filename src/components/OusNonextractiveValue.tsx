                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the <b>value</b> those surveyed place
                  on different areas of the EEZ, an Ocean Use Survey was
                  conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they participate
                  in and for fishing sectors, the gear types they use. They were
                  then asked to draw the areas they use relative to that sector
                  and assign a <b>value of importance</b>. Individual responses
                  were then combined to produce aggregate heatmaps of{" "}
                  <b>value</b> by sector. This allows the value of areas to be
                  quantified, summed, and compared to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The area-based value of ocean use is used as a proxy for
                  measuring the potential economic loss to sectors caused by the
                  creation of protected areas. This report can be used to
                  identify and minimize the potential impact of a plan on a
                  sector, as well as identify and reduce conflict between
                  conservation objectives and a given sector. The higher the
                  percentage of value within the plan, the greater the potential
                  impact to the sector if access or activities are restricted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                  individuals that were surveyed.
