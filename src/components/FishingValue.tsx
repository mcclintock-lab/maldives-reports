                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the <b>value</b> fishers place on
                  different areas of the EEZ, an Ocean Use Survey was conducted.
                  Individuals identified the sectors they participate in and
                  gear types they use. They were then asked to draw the areas
                  they use relative to that sector and assign a{" "}
                  <b>value of importance</b>. Individual responses were then
                  combined to produce aggregate heatmaps of <b></b> by sector.
                  This allows the value of areas to be quantified, summed, and
                  compared to one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fishing value is used as a proxy for measuring the potential
                  economic loss to fisheries caused by the creation of protected
                  areas. This report can be used to identify and minimize the
                  potential impact of a plan on a fishery, as well as identify
                  and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and
                  fishing activities. The higher the percentage of value within
                  the plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if
                  access or activities are restricted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                  individuals that were surveyed.

                  the total fishing value in the overall planning area. If the
                  plan includes multiple areas that overlap, the overlap is only
                  counted once.
